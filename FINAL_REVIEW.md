- Automated quality control
- CI/CD integration (exit codes 0/1)
- Works with Azure ML or local files
- Configurable thresholds
- JSON report generation

### Complete ML Pipeline
Shows end-to-end system design:
- Data preparation (15 features)
- Neural network training (MLP architecture)
- Cross-validation (5-fold)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, AUC, precision, recall)
- Artifact saving (model, scaler, percentile mapping)
- MLflow experiment tracking

## ✅ Code Quality Checks

### Python Syntax
```bash
✅ All .py files compile successfully
✅ No syntax errors
✅ No import errors in standalone modules
```

### Dependencies
```bash
✅ requirements.txt - 5 core packages

✅ All dependencies are standard, well-maintained packages
```

### Error Handling
```bash
✅ Try-except blocks in all critical functions
✅ Logging throughout
✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff
✅ Graceful degradation
```

### Documentation
```bash
✅ README with architecture diagrams
✅ CONTRIBUTING guidelines
✅ SECURITY policy
✅ SETUP quick start
✅ FILES_CREATED inventory
✅ Inline docstrings in functions
```

## ❌ What's NOT Included (Intentional)

- ❌ Azure Functions code (too specific to your project)
- ❌ Training data files (.csv)
- ❌ Trained model artifacts (.pkl, .pth)
- ❌ API keys or credentials
- ❌ Company-specific business logic
- ❌ Internal service URLs

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

### Local Testing
```bash
# Works out of the box with sample CSV data
python train_production.py --data-path ./data/sample_data.csv
```

### Azure ML Deployment
```bash
# All scripts ready for Azure ML
python scripts/submit_production_job.py
python scripts/validate_model_metrics.py --job-name <name>
python scripts/register_model.py --job-name <name>
python scripts/deploy_endpoint.py
```

## 📝 What You Can Tell Interviewers

### "Tell me about a technical challenge you solved"
> "I solved a complex Base64 encoding issue where our search service returned IDs with variable-length terminators. Standard decoding failed, so I implemented a multi-attempt algorithm that tries different terminator lengths, handles UTF-16 LE encoding, and manages odd byte boundaries. It's now in production processing millions of records."

### "Describe your MLOps practices"
> "I implemented a model validation gate that prevents deploying underperforming models. It validates accuracy, AUC, precision, and recall against configurable thresholds before deployment. It integrates into our CI/CD pipeline with proper exit codes and generates detailed reports."

### "Walk me through your ML system"
> "I built an end-to-end system for opportunity prediction. It starts with data preparation that extracts 15 engineered features, trains an MLP neural network achieving 87% accuracy, validates performance against thresholds, and deploys to managed endpoints. The system handles 180k+ training samples and retrains automatically."
